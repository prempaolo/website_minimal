<h1>Lf, the perfect terminal file manager</h1><h1>Lf, the perfect terminal file manager</h1>

<p>When I first saw <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, I immediately loved it. You can manage your files entirely from your command line in an awesome way. Here is a screenshot of its interface:</p>

<p>Its biggest flaw? Python!!</p>

<p>I started using it instead of the <code>cd</code> command to navigate through my filesystem and I noticed an incredibly annoying delay of &frac12; seconds before it would open. This is the reason I started to look for some faster alternatives. I tried <a href="https://github.com/vifm/vifm">vifm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">nnn</a> but then I found <a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a>, a file manager written in go. Not only it is faster than ranger, but it also looks very similar. Here is a screenshot of its interface:</p>

<p><img src="../data/pics/lf.png" alt="Lf" /></p>

<p>By default, when you close lf with the <em>q</em> key, it doesn&rsquo;t exit in the current directory, but it returns to the one where you ran it. Since I am    using it to navigate into my filesystem, I searched in their documentation how to   add this functionality. They provide a snippet of code that keeps track of the current directory and automatically <code>cd</code> into that. Here is the snippet:
<code>
lfcd () {
  tmp="$(mktemp)"
  /bin/lf -last-dir-path="$tmp" "$@"
  if [ -f "$tmp" ]; then
      dir="$(cat "$tmp")"
      rm -f "$tmp"
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
          if [ "$dir" != "$(pwd)" ]; then
              cd "$dir"
          fi
      fi
  fi
}
</code>
Therefore, I created a new file, called <em>lfcd</em> and I sourced it in my <em>.zshrc</em> (if you use bash, source it in you <em>.bashrc</em>):
<code>
source "/path/to/my/lfcd/file/lfcd.sh"
</code>
In this way I was able to navigate my filesystem only using lf. Nice! So, I was thinking, is there something that I can do with a GUI file manager that I cannot do with my current configuration of lf? And two things came to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag and drop</li>
<li><p>Manage pictures and photos</p>

<p>  For the first thing I did a quick search on Google and found an awesome project called <a href="https://github.com/mwh/dragon">dragon drag and drop</a> that could create from the command line a simple window with the selected file/s to drag and drop. I immediately downloaded it and imlemented it into my configuration of lf adding the following snippet of code to the lfrc config file:
```</p>

<h1>Open drag and drop with t</h1>

<p>map t $dragon-drag-and-drop -a -x $fx &amp;
```
In this way, using the <em>t</em> key, I can create a window with all the selected files and easily drag and drop them into any applications that support this functionality.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For the other task, i.e. managing photos and pictures, I thought at first that the most effective way to do that was to implement any sort of image preview within the terminal and within lf. Fortunately, I was wrong, the most simple and effective way was to use a program called <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a>. It&rsquo;s a simple image previewer that has a lot of potential, including custom scripts to execute on certain key combination. Maybe I will write another article only about that, for the moment I would just stick with the configuration with lf starting with an example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have some pictures named with the time and date they are taken, like it is shown in the picture below:</p>

<p><img src="../data/pics/lf_pictures.png" alt="Pictures with annoying names" /></p>

<p>My first approach was closing lf, opening sxiv with all the pictures in the target folder, chose the one I wanted to edit/move and then remember the name to be sure I selected the right picture. This operation was much simpler using a GUI file manager where you just select the one you are interested in. I couldn&rsquo;t accept it and therefore, I informed myself on both lf and sxiv and after some tries I found the perfect combination, and this was achieved by adding the following line to my <code>lfrc</code>:
```</p>

<h1>Open all images in current folder in sxiv and select marked image</h1>

<p>map L $lf -remote &ldquo;send $id select &lsquo;$(sxiv -o .<em>)&rsquo;&rdquo;
<code>``
Let's start with the first command executed, i.e.</code>sxiv -o .</em><code>. This command simply opens sxiv with the</code>-o` option in the current folder with all the files it is able to process (images). The specified option is used to <em>&ldquo;write list of all marked files to standard output when quitting&rdquo;</em>, as also mentioned in its man page. When using sxiv, you can mark an image by simply pressing the <em>m</em> key. Then, when you quit sxiv, its name is printed in the standard output. An example is shonw in the gif below:</p>

<p><img src="../data/pics/sxiv_name_output.gif" alt="Sxiv -o returns the name of the marked picture when quitted" /></p>

<p>The name is then processed by the second command <code>lf -remote "send $id select 'name-of-marked-file'"</code>. Lf has a running server in the background and differentiates the different instances using ids. With the previous command we are telling the server (using the <em>lf -remote</em>) to make the instance identified by <em>\$id</em> to select the file corresponding by the last string. By default, every instance of lf has its id stored into the <em>\$id</em> variable, accessible only inside the <em>lfrc</em> configuration file.</p>

<p>TL;DR In this way I can open sxiv with all the images in a folder by pressing <em>L</em> inside lf and then selecting on lf the marked image when quitting sxiv.</p>
