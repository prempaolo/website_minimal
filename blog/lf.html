<h1>Lf, the perfect terminal file manager</h1><p>
When I first saw <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, I immediately loved it. You can manage your files entirely from your command line in an awesome way. Here is a screenshot of its interface:

<p>
Its biggest flaw? Python!
</p>
<p>
I started using it instead of the <code>cd</code> command to navigate through my filesystem and I noticed an incredibly annoying delay of 1/2 seconds before it would open. This is the reason I started to look for some faster alternatives. I tried <a href="https://github.com/vifm/vifm">vifm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">nnn</a> but then I found <a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a>, a file manager written in go. Not only it is faster than ranger, but it also looks very similar. Here is a screenshot of its interface:

<p>
By default, when you close lf with the <i>q</i> key, it doesn't exit in the current directory, but it returns to the one where you ran it. Since I am	using it to navigate into my filesystem, I searched in their documentation how to	add this functionality. They provide a snippet of code that keeps track of the current directory and automatically <code>cd</code> into that. Here is the snippet:
</p>
<pre><code>
lfcd () {
  tmp="&#36;(mktemp)"
  /bin/lf -last-dir-path="&#36;tmp" "&#36;@"
  if [ -f "&#36;tmp" ]; then
      dir="&#36;(cat "&#36;tmp")"
      rm -f "&#36;tmp"
      if [ -d "&#36;dir" ]; then
          if [ "&#36;dir" != "&#36;(pwd)" ]; then
              cd "&#36;dir"
          fi
      fi
  fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Therefore, I created a new file, called <i>lfcd</i> and I sourced it in my <i>.zshrc</i> (if you use bash, source it in you <i>.bashrc</i>):
</p>
<pre><code>
source "/path/to/my/lfcd/file/lfcd.sh"
</code></pre>
<p>
In this way I was able to navigate my filesystem only using lf. Nice! So, I was thinking, is there something that I can do with a GUI file manager that I cannot do with my current configuration of lf? And two things came to my mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag and drop</li>
<li>Manage pictures and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For the first thing I did a quick search on Google and found an awesome project called <a href="https://github.com/mwh/dragon">dragon drag and drop</a> that could create from the command line a simple window with the selected file/s to drag and drop. I immediately downloaded it and imlemented it into my configuration of lf adding the following snippet of code to the lfrc config file:
</p>
<pre><code>
# Open drag and drop with t
map t &#36;dragon-drag-and-drop -a -x &#36;fx &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>
In this way, using the <i>t</i> key, I can create a window with all the selected files and easily drag and drop them into any applications that support this functionality.
</p>
<p>
For the other task, i.e. managing photos and pictures, I thought at first that the most effective way to do that was to implement any sort of image preview within the terminal and within lf. Fortunately, I was wrong, the most simple and effective way was to use a program called <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a>. It's a simple image previewer that has a lot of potential, including custom scripts to execute on certain key combination. Maybe I will write another article only about that, for the moment I would just stick with the configuration with lf starting with an example.
</p>
<p>
Let's say I have some pictures named with the time and date they are taken, like it is shown in the picture below:
</p>
<p>
<img src="../data/pics/lf_pictures.png" alt="Pictures with annoying names"/>
</p>
<p>
My first approach was closing lf, opening sxiv with all the pictures in the target folder, chose the one I wanted to edit/move and then remember the name to be sure I selected the right picture. This operation was much simpler using a GUI file manager where you just select the one you are interested in. I couldn't accept it and therefore, I informed myself on both lf and sxiv and after some tries I found the perfect combination, and this was achieved by adding the following line to my <code>lfrc</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>
# Open all images in current folder in sxiv and select marked image
map L &#36;lf -remote "send &#36;id select '&#36;(sxiv -o .*)'"
</code></pre>
<p>
Let's start with the first command executed, i.e. <code>sxiv -o .*</code>. This command simply opens sxiv with the <code>-o</code> option in the current folder with all the files it is able to process (images). The specified option is used to <i>"write list of all marked files to standard output when quitting"</i>, as also mentioned in its man page. When using sxiv, you can mark an image by simply pressing the <i>m</i> key. Then, when you quit sxiv, its name is printed in the standard output. An example is shonw in the gif below:
</p>
<p>
<img src="../data/pics/sxiv_name_output.gif" alt="Sxiv -o returns the name of the marked picture when quitted"/>
</p>
<p>
The name is then processed by the second command <code>lf -remote "send  select 'name-of-marked-file'"</code>. Lf has a running server in the background and differentiates the different instances using ids. With the previous command we are telling the server (using the <i>lf -remote</i>) to make the instance identified by <i>&#36;id</i> to select the file corresponding by the last string. By default, every instance of lf has its id stored into the <i>&#36;id</i> variable, accessible only inside the <i>lfrc</i> configuration file.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR In this way I can open sxiv with all the images in a folder by pressing <i>L</i> inside lf and then selecting on lf the marked image when quitting sxiv.
