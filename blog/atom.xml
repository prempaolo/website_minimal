<summary type="text">[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) is a great tool to manage your rss feeds from the command line. However, it just displays the content of a feed and, most of the time, this is just a minimal part of the entire article.

Fortunately, this is not the case for everyone and there are still people who really took the right essence out of it. Some people think that the minimalism is just about having the less features possible on your programs and they probably just make their everyday life a lot harder because of that.</summary>
